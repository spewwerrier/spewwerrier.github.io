<h1 id="case-studies-introduction">Case Studies Introduction</h1>
<p>E-governance is the application of information and communication
technology (ICT) by public sector organizations to improve the way they
deliver services to citizens and businesses. It is essential for
transforming public administration by enhancing the accessibility,
efficiency, and transparency of government services.</p>
<p>This report examines three e-governance initiatives in Nepal:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Government Integrated Data Management Center
[https://idmc.gov.np/]{.underline} GIDC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public Procurement Monitoring Office
[https://www.bolpatra.gov.np/egp/]{.underline} PPMO</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Department of Transport management
[https://www.dotm.gov.np/]{.underline} DOTM</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="government-integrated-data-management-center-gidc">Government Integrated Data Management Center (GIDC)</h1>
<p><strong>Narrative</strong><br />
The Government Integrated Data Management Center serves as a central
facility for managing all the governmental data and providing the
essential IT infrastructure web services. These services include: Domain
Registration, Internet, Web Hosting, Technical consultation, Server
Colocation, VM / VPS, Email, Singhadurbar Network, Backup and
Replication [@IDMCServices]. GIDC aims to integrate every government
services on a singular network for interoperability.</p>
<p><strong>Impacts and outcomes</strong><br />
GIDC provides its services to further enhance the reliability and
security of governmental services. It also aims to centralize the data
management and aims to improve efficiency and coordination across
government bodies.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong><br />
Establishing and maintaining data centers in developing countries like
Nepal face significant challenges due to high energy cost, availability
of electricity, lack of fund to create reliable backups, and lack of
educated manpower to manage the infrastructure. Most of the human
resources employed at the data center are temporary. Many do not have
specific qualifications, skills, and expertise. Sources say the center
does not have staff that are knowledgeable about networking, database,
cooling, power and other infrastructure [@DataLossInNepal]. Due to these
issues currently the service is sub-optimal at best with multiple
downtime being the norm.</p>
<p><strong>Comparative Analysis</strong><br />
Hosted in Kathmandu with a Disaster Recovery Center in Hetauda the GIDC
lacks enforceable data policies. Agencies like the Public Service
Commission lost 85,000+ records due to uncoordinated backups
[@DataLossInNepal]. Compared to Singapore government tech agencies
enforces struct SLAs (Service Level Agreements), mandatory ISO 27001
audits and, centralized incident response.</p>
<p>Nepal funding and development of data center mostly relies on outside
money (foreign aid). This makes us incapable to update and change our
data center by ourself. Compared to other countries like Vietnam which
launches its own data centers [@VietnamDataCenter] we need to rely on
countries like Korea [@NepalKoreaDIGC].</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation Summary</strong><br />
Based on the analysis done we can safely say that Nepal still needs a
huge improvement for creating a reputable and trustworthy data center.
It should update its legacy system, increase the GIDC budget, and should
not shy itself from foreign aid. Data Center should have a strict
downtime policy, human resources should be skilled and hired purely
based on skills and experience. Beyond that Nepal should also enforce
mandatory ISO audits and take any form of security seriously thus not
relying on legacy software with public CVEs.</p>
<h1 id="electronic-government-procurement-system-ppmo-e-gp-bolpatra">Electronic Government Procurement System (PPMO e-GP) Bolpatra</h1>
<p><strong>Narrative</strong><br />
Bolpatra is the centralized e-Government Procurement system managed by
Procurement Monitoring Office (PPMO). The web based portal covers
various stages of the public procurement lifecycle, including bidder
registration, procurement planning, e-tendering, online evaluation and
contract management. The system is designed for use by all ministries,
departments, and agencies of Government of Nepal and it hosted at GIDC.
It works by publishing a bid in Bolpatra and companies providing the
goods mentioned in bids can publish their bids to fulfill the request.
Company that is ready to fulfill bids with lowest amount of bid wins the
bid. One example can be, Nepal Public HealthCare needing medicines, it
then publishes bids with the description and proper template. Medicine
Industries then put their bids and one with lowest bids win the bids and
is allowed to fulfill the request.</p>
<p><strong>Impacts and outcomes</strong><br />
The e-GP system aims to enhance transparency, efficiency, and accuracy
in public procurement process by providing centralized online platform.
It simplifies procedures for both government entities and bidders,
potentially reducing the instances of corruption and improving public
confidence in fairness. Digitizing procurement system increased the
organization participation and decreased the politics in the bids. Every
company can remotely participate in the bidding process digitally making
the bidding process safer as well. It also ensured the bids were fair
and lowest bids were not leaked to other competitors where they can
decrease their bid by 1 rupee and win the bid.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong><br />
The adoption of e-procurement system in Nepal can be challenging due to
several factors. These include inadequate ICT infrastructure, low levels
of digital literacy among potential users (both government officials and
bidders), and the need for a supportive legal and regulatory framework.
Resistance to change within government institutions and a lack of
awareness about the benefits of e-procurement systems can also act as
barriers.</p>
<p><strong>Comparative Analysis</strong><br />
Procurement in Untied States is managed by FAR (Federal Acquisition
Regulation) [@FAR] which lists all the rules, regulation, process,
types, and other clauses clearly in order for procurement. There are
various types of bidding and contracts types in FAR. These are easily
searchable and listed in FAR public website which makes the information
and knowledge on procurement accessible to general people. Bolpatra also
has a publicly available manuals
[@BolpatraUserManual; @BolpatraOperatingProcedure] but its not on same
accessibility level as of FAR.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation Summary</strong><br />
PPMO in Nepal is transparent and works for country like Nepal. All the
transactions are transparent and can be easily viewable in Bolpatra's
official website. The only concern except the website looking old is the
rules: bid and contracts types are not easily viewable in their website.
Beside this the bolpatra website works fine and all the current and
expired bids can be seen in their website. In Nepal's context the method
to popularize e-GP is by raising awareness about e-procurement and
making the rules easily searchable as we have seen in other countries.</p>
<h1 id="department-of-transport-management-dotm">Department of Transport Management (DOTM)</h1>
<p><strong>Narrative</strong><br />
The Department of Transport Management (DOTM) is the central government
body responsible for regulating, developing, and managing Nepal's
transport sector. DOTM offers several online services to citizens, such
as the online driver's license application system, online vehicle
registration system, online driving license, embossed number plate
system, and the ability to search for driver's license details.</p>
<p><strong>Impacts and outcomes</strong><br />
Online services in DOTM makes it easy and accessible to register for the
driving license. It streamlines the process of applying for license and
acquiring the license. It does this by allowing online application and
inquiries. DOTM intends to reduce the need for physical visits to
government offices, saving time and effort. This leads to faster
workflow as license can be obtained within 24 hours of completion of
driving license trail in apps like nagarik.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong><br />
The effective implementation and utilization of online transport
management systems in Nepal face challenges related to digital device,
particularly in older generation and rural communities where digital
literacy and internet accessibility are low. And major part of transport
management has not been digitized yet. The method of license and
bluebook renewal still need office visits. Only the license access is
digital as of now, bluebook and vehicle tracking has not yet been
digitized to citizens. This is a huge accessibility concern when
renewing documents as well as paying the vehicle tax and its insurance.
Sites like Khatapana claims the vehicle tax can be paid using nagarik
[@Khatapana], this feature was removed in 2023 and is completely offline
process as of now. Currently, the online renewal of bluebook in
e-payment app requires sharing information to third party who needs a
physical access to the bluebook for the offline renewal process, this
poses a security concern.</p>
<p><strong>Comparative Analysis</strong><br />
In countries like India, the payment of vehicle tax and the vehicle
renewal process are readily available online [@Parivahan]. Nepal process
for these services still mandates in-person office visits. This poses a
huge accessibility concern to time constraint citizens and older
generations.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation Summary</strong><br />
Citizens should be made aware of online services and general acceptance
should be created in community. Many older generations still believe
that digital license won't be applicable in real scenario. Beside that
DOTM should focus on digitizing the whole ecosystem rather than just the
license card. Taxation, insurance, and documents renewals should be
digitized through the means of online payment services.</p>
